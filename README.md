# Palmer et al., Cell (2017)
Source code and data for article "Combination cancer therapy can confer benefit via patient-to-patient
variability without drug additivity or synergy" by Palmer et al.

Each piece of source code is provided in a folder containing the code as a Mathematica
Notebook (.nb file type), all source data required by the code, and a PDF printout of the
Mathematica Notebook that presents both the code and its output for convenience of reading.
With any source data kept within the same folder as the code, the Mathematica Notebook can be
executed in Wolfram Mathematica version 11 by selecting ‘Evaluate Notebook’ from the
‘Evaluation’ menu.

| Figure 5A, B, C | `PDX analysis code.nb` |
| Figure 5D | `Figure 4, clinical trials analysis code.nb` <br> General-purpose code for prediction of drug combination effects from clinical data of individual therapies is provided in `Prediction from monotherapy trials code.nb` |
| Figure 6A | This figure is a schematic and not data; code is not available. |
| Figure 6B, C, D, E, F | `Figure 6 model code.nb` |
| Figure S1 | This figure is an illustration of the procedure conducted in the following files: <br> `Figure 1A code.nb`, `Figure 1BC code.nb`, `Figure 4, clinical trials analysis code.nb`, and the general-purpose code in `Prediction from monotherapy trials code.nb` |

| Figure S3 (all panels) | `PDX analysis code.nb` |
| Figure S4 (all panels) | `PDX analysis code.nb` |
| Figure S5A | `Figure 1BC code.nb`, and `Figure 4, clinical trials analysis code.nb` |
| Figure S5B | Figure was produced by a variant of `Figure 4, clinical trials analysis code.nb`, using data provided in accompanying file `Table of survival distributions.xlsx` |
| Figure S6 (all panels) | `PDX analysis code.nb` |
| Figure S7A | Produced by ~20 variants of `Figure 6 model code.nb`. These simulations can be executed using the provided code by adjusting tumor kinetics parameters and drug resistance parameters to the values shown in Figure S7A. |
